### Version info

This app was originally generated on Thu Jan 03 2019 22:03:41 GMT+0100 (CET) using Sails v1.0.2. by user basskibo



### Prerequisite
+ Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download) 
+ Sails.js (https://sailsjs.com/get-started) - install globally with sudo npm i -g 
+ MySQL (https://www.mysql.com/downloads)
+ MySQL Workbench (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench)


### Getting started
Project is divided into two parts, one is backend (server) in folder named 'poslovna_backend' whereas frontend part is in folder 'poslovna_frontend'.
For backend we are using Sails.js more details in next chapter, on the other hand frontend side is using Angular.
+ First install npm modules with command 'npm install' or 'sudo npm install'. To start backend server navigate to backend folder and enter command 'sails lift' which will lift server on port 3005.
(http://localhost:3005)

+ First install npm modules with command 'npm install' or 'sudo npm install'.  To start frontend server go to frontend folder and execute 'sudo npm start' (I personally use sudo on Linux OS, you can also use it on OS X,
but if you are using Windows you will not use sudo). It will start on port 4200. (http://localhost:4200)
